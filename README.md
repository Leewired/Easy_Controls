# Easy_Controls
Control creating script for Maya. 


## About the tool

This tool creates zeroed out controls for selected objects and gives options to handle offsets, color and constraints in bulk.

It works solidly, but it is not a finished project.
This is a simple tool that I've mostly used for controls for face joints and FK-chains.

Here are some incoming developments:
* Position based coloring (left, right, middle)
* Add more range for scale and offset values
* Make UI clearer
* Fix annoying dialog that pops up for each(!) control if transformations do not match when constraining
* Add support for full control library

This tool was created for speeding up the control creating process and for coding practice. I am still an inexperienced coder, and will gladly accept criticism and advice.
